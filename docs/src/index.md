# Rating curve fitting in Julia

*RatingCurves.jl* provides exhaustive high-performance functions for fitting power-law rating curves in Julia, such as:
* Fitting power-law rating curve to gaugings by minimizing the total sum of squares in the log space.
* Fitting compoud power-law rating curve to gaugings by minimizing the total sum of squares in the log space.
* Computing the parameter uncertainties.
* Computing the discharge prediction uncertainty.
